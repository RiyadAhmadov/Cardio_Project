## Overview

This project aims to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in individuals based on various health-related features. Cardiovascular disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and predictive models can help identify individuals at risk, enabling early intervention and prevention.

## Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project aims to develop predictive models that can assess an individual's risk of developing CVD based on health-related features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors. These models can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.

## Data Description

### Data Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age:** Age of the individuals in days.
- **Height:** Height of the individuals in centimeters (cm).
- **Weight:** Weight of the individuals in kilograms (kg).
- **Gender:** Gender of the individuals (categorical code).
- **Systolic Blood Pressure:** Systolic blood pressure (ap_hi) measured during examinations.
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (ap_lo) measured during examinations.
- **Cholesterol:** Cholesterol levels (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal).
- **Glucose:** Glucose levels (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal).
- **Smoking:** Smoking status (binary: 0 for non-smokers, 1 for smokers).
- **Alcohol Intake:** Alcohol intake status (binary: 0 for non-drinkers, 1 for drinkers).
- **Physical Activity:** Physical activity status (binary: 0 for inactive, 1 for active).
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** The presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (binary: 0 for absence, 1 for presence).

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset]. Please refer to the original source for additional information and citation requirements.

## Data Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset may require preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Preprocessing ensures that the data is ready for analysis and modeling.

## Predictive Modeling

The dataset can be used for predictive modeling to build models that predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on the provided features. Machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or deep learning can be applied to create predictive models.
